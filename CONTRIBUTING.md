## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build. Please do not commit temporary files to the repo.
2. Update the documentation in the documentation/-folder with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Add a tutorial how to use your new feature in form of a jupyter notebook to the documentation, as well. This makes sure that others can use your code!
4. Add test cases to our unit test system for your contribution.
5. Increase the version numbers in any exampleâ€™s files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/). Add your changes to the CHANGELOG.md. Address the issue numbers that you are solving.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
